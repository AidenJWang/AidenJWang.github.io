This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

Welcome to Aiden Wang's Personal Website

I'm Aiden Wang, a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech, passionate about embedded systems, circuit design, networking, and programming. My academic journey is fueled by my curiosity for technology and how it shapes our interaction with devices, making them more efficient and functional.

About Me
======
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech (expected May 2026). My studies have provided me with a deep understanding of computer architectures, digital systems, and applied software design. Through both coursework and hands-on projects, I have refined my skills in C/C++, MATLAB, circuit design, and embedded systems.

I thrive on innovation and problem-solving, always looking for opportunities to develop solutions that improve efficiency and expand the applications of modern technology.
